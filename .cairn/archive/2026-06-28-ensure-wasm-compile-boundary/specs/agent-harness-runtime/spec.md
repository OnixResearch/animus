# agent-harness-runtime Change Spec: Wasm compile boundary

## Requirements

### Requirement: Wasm-supported surface

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.surface] Animus MUST define a Wasm-supported crate and feature surface for deterministic embedders, initially targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and including only crates that do not require ambient std shell services.

#### Scenario: Embedders select a portable surface

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.surface.portable]
- GIVEN an embedder wants Animus logic in a Wasm module
- WHEN they select the documented Wasm-supported crate and feature profile
- THEN the selected surface includes deterministic reusable contracts such as core state and adapter DTOs
- AND it excludes std shell orchestration, terminal UI, provider clients, native persistence, process execution, and filesystem authority unless a later target-specific contract accepts them.

### Requirement: Root facade supports a no-std Wasm profile

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.root_facade] The root `animus` facade MUST be able to expose a no-std-compatible profile for the Wasm-supported surface without requiring `animus-std`, terminal, process, filesystem, provider, or native persistence dependencies.

#### Scenario: Root no-std profile avoids shell dependencies

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.root_facade.no_shell]
- GIVEN the root facade is built for the documented Wasm target without std shell features
- WHEN dependency resolution and compile checks run
- THEN shell-only crates are not required by that build
- AND std-backed convenience APIs remain available only under documented host-shell features or host-target builds.

### Requirement: Wasm compile rail

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.rail] Animus MUST provide a credential-free Wasm compile rail that checks the documented supported surface against the accepted Wasm target and reports deterministic evidence for review.

#### Scenario: Compile rail catches portability drift

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.rail.drift]
- GIVEN a change introduces an incompatible dependency or target assumption into the Wasm-supported surface
- WHEN the Wasm compile rail runs
- THEN the rail fails before review claims Wasm support
- AND the diagnostic identifies the crate or feature profile that no longer compiles.

### Requirement: Shell isolation for Wasm support

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.shell_isolation] Animus MUST keep std shell, terminal, Steel runtime, provider, native persistence, process, filesystem, network, credential, clock, and host execution dependencies outside the Wasm-supported surface unless guarded by target or feature gates that the Wasm rail does not enable.

#### Scenario: Host behavior remains explicit

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.shell_isolation.explicit]
- GIVEN a host wants process, filesystem, provider, terminal, browser, WASI, plugin, or persistence behavior
- WHEN it composes Animus with host services
- THEN that behavior crosses explicit adapter or shell contracts
- AND Wasm compile support alone does not imply those host behaviors are present or authorized.

### Requirement: Optional bridge participation is explicit

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.optional_bridges] Optional bridge crates such as Preserves MAY join the Wasm rail only after their target compatibility, dependency behavior, and adapter-DTO revalidation path are documented and tested.

#### Scenario: Optional bridge support is not assumed

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.optional_bridges.evidence]
- GIVEN an optional bridge is considered for Wasm support
- WHEN closeout evidence is prepared
- THEN it either includes successful Wasm compile evidence and positive/negative boundary tests for that bridge
- OR records the blocker and excludes the bridge from the supported Wasm surface.

### Requirement: Wasm closeout evidence

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.closeout] Boundary-affecting Wasm support changes MUST include reviewable evidence for the focused Wasm rail, relevant crate tests, workspace checks, Cairn validation, and Cairn gates, with unavailable checks recorded alongside blockers and next-best validation.

#### Scenario: Reviewers can distinguish support from non-claims

r[agent_harness_runtime.wasm_compile.closeout.non_claims]
- GIVEN a Wasm support change is ready to archive
- WHEN reviewers inspect its evidence
- THEN the evidence names the exact crate and feature surface that compiles for Wasm
- AND it explicitly lists excluded runtime claims such as browser APIs, WASI host behavior, plugin loading, providers, terminal UI, process execution, filesystem access, credentials, and native persistence.
