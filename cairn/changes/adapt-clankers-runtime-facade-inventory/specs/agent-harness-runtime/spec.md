# agent-harness-runtime Change Spec: Clankers runtime facade inventory

## Requirements

### Requirement: Bounded runtime facade inventory adoption

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.scope] Animus MUST adopt Clankers' runtime-facade inventory pattern only as a bounded architecture and verification rail, not as a dependency on Clankers runtime crates or product surfaces.

#### Scenario: Inventory adoption rejects product surfaces

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.scope.rejects_product]
- GIVEN maintainers adapt Clankers runtime-facade inventory ideas
- WHEN the adoption scope is documented
- THEN Animus distinguishes export-classification discipline from Clankers daemon, TUI, provider router, plugin runtime, auth flow, process manager, desktop storage, and product shell behavior
- AND reusable Animus crates do not import Clankers runtime crates for the inventory.

### Requirement: Public export inventory schema

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.schema] Animus MUST define an inventory record schema for runtime-facing public exports that records export path, owning crate, source module or marker, class, side-effect allowance, stability intent, review note, and safe evidence metadata.

#### Scenario: Export records name owners and authority class

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.schema.owner_class]
- GIVEN a runtime-facing public export is included in the inventory
- WHEN reviewers inspect the record
- THEN the record names the owning crate and source location or marker
- AND it classifies the export as a reusable contract, host-injection surface, or shell adapter.

### Requirement: Export classes preserve reusable boundaries

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.classification] Runtime-facing public exports MUST be classified as reusable contracts, host-injection surfaces, or shell adapters, and each class MUST define forbidden side effects.

#### Scenario: Reusable contract remains no-ambient

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.classification.reusable_no_ambient]
- GIVEN an export is classified as a reusable contract
- WHEN the inventory rail checks it
- THEN the export does not require ambient filesystem, environment, credentials, clocks, randomness, network, provider discovery, TUI state, daemon frames, plugin launch, process execution, or concrete persistence
- AND any needed authority is represented through a host-injection surface or shell adapter instead.

#### Scenario: Host injection fails closed by default

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.classification.fail_closed]
- GIVEN an export is classified as a host-injection surface
- WHEN the default service or adapter is absent, unavailable, denied, cancelled, or unsupported
- THEN it fails closed with typed status or denial metadata
- AND it does not silently create a shell adapter, read ambient config, discover providers, or contact backends.

### Requirement: Focused inventory rail

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.rail] Animus MUST provide a focused static rail or equivalent deterministic test that fails on unclassified runtime-facing public exports, missing owner metadata, class and side-effect contradictions, and unsafe evidence fields.

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.positive] The inventory rail MUST accept fixtures or real exports for pure DTOs, validation helpers, adapter traits, and deny-by-default host service seams.

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.negative] The inventory rail MUST reject fixtures or real exports that classify ambient filesystem, environment, credential, clock, network, provider, TUI, daemon, plugin, process, or persistence behavior as reusable contracts.

#### Scenario: Positive and negative fixtures guard classification

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.rail.fixtures]
- GIVEN inventory fixtures or real exports include reusable contracts, host-injection seams, and unsafe shell-authority examples
- WHEN the focused inventory rail runs
- THEN valid reusable and host-injection surfaces are accepted
- AND unsafe ambient-authority examples are rejected as reusable contracts.

#### Scenario: Unclassified exports fail review

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.rail.unclassified]
- GIVEN a runtime-facing crate adds a public export without inventory classification
- WHEN the focused inventory rail runs
- THEN it fails with an actionable diagnostic naming the missing classification
- AND it does not require live providers, host credentials, plugin runtimes, daemon sessions, or TUI state.

### Requirement: Safe inventory evidence and docs

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.evidence] Inventory evidence MUST include schema/status, checked crates, class counts, fixture names, safe diagnostics, and content hashes when needed, and MUST omit raw prompts, provider payloads, credentials, environment values, full host paths, and tool output.

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.docs] Animus README or architecture docs MUST link to an inventory summary that tells embedders which surfaces are default-safe reusable contracts, host-owned injection points, or shell-only adapters.

#### Scenario: Closeout evidence separates claims from non-claims

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_runtime_facade_inventory.closeout]
- GIVEN the runtime facade inventory change is ready to archive
- WHEN closeout validation runs
- THEN evidence includes the focused inventory rail, positive and negative fixtures, dependency checks, docs links, Cairn validation, and Cairn gates
- AND skipped checks or non-claims such as live providers, TUI dogfood, daemon tests, plugin runtime tests, VM checks, or production readiness are identified explicitly.
