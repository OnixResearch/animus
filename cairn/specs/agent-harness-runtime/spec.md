# Agent Harness Runtime Specification

## Purpose

Defines the accepted baseline for Animus as a modular Rust agent-harness framework with explicit crate barriers, typed adapter contracts, a Steel decision fabric, and standard-library host shells.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Crate boundary baseline

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.crate_boundaries] The workspace MUST preserve explicit crate boundaries between pure core state, implementation-free adapter contracts, optional Preserves boundary serialization, Steel turn decisions, standard-library host orchestration, optional terminal UI hosting, and the root compatibility facade.

#### Scenario: Embedders choose the smallest surface

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.crate_boundaries.smallest_dependency]
- GIVEN an embedder needs only deterministic state logic, adapter DTOs, serialization, Steel scripting, std shell orchestration, or TUI hosting
- WHEN they select workspace crates
- THEN each reusable crate exposes only its owned boundary
- AND concrete host, provider, filesystem, process, network, and UI behavior stays outside unrelated reusable crates.

### Requirement: Functional core and imperative shell split

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.functional_core] Non-trivial Animus behavior MUST be decomposed into pure deterministic core logic over explicit inputs and thin imperative shells for filesystem, process, environment, network, terminal, credential, clock, and persistence effects.

#### Scenario: Core logic is testable without standing up the world

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.functional_core.testable]
- GIVEN runtime, policy, adapter, prompt, provenance, or serialization logic contains branch decisions
- WHEN maintainers add or change that behavior
- THEN the branch decisions are represented as deterministic functions over in-memory values
- AND tests can exercise positive and negative cases without real providers, shells, terminals, credentials, or storage backends.

### Requirement: Adapter-first integration boundary

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.adapters] Model, tool, memory, ledger, queue, policy, confirmation, provider, workspace, and host integrations MUST cross typed adapter or service contracts rather than being constructed by reusable runtime core code.

#### Scenario: Missing host services fail closed

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.adapters.missing_service]
- GIVEN reusable runtime logic requires a host capability
- WHEN the corresponding adapter or service is absent, denied, unavailable, malformed, or cancelled
- THEN runtime returns a typed failure before claiming completed effects
- AND it does not discover ambient config, read credentials, spawn commands, or contact providers as a fallback.

### Requirement: Steel decision fabric baseline

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.steel_fabric] Animus SHOULD use Steel Scheme as the default scriptable turn-decision fabric while Rust boundary code MUST revalidate every selected model, tool, memory, response, or host action before dispatch.

#### Scenario: Script decisions are revalidated

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.steel_fabric.revalidated]
- GIVEN a Steel script returns a loop decision
- WHEN Rust runtime code receives that decision
- THEN the decision is decoded through typed boundary DTOs
- AND malformed payloads, unsupported actions, unauthorized effects, or invalid text fail closed before adapter dispatch.

### Requirement: Nickel-owned repository configuration

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.nickel_config] Repo-owned tool and policy configuration MUST use Nickel as the source of truth when Animus owns the config shape, while generated tool-native artifacts are kept fresh for consumers that require JSON, TOML, YAML, or other native formats.

#### Scenario: Generated config drift is detectable

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.nickel_config.drift]
- GIVEN maintainers change repo-owned Nickel configuration
- WHEN generated native config files are checked
- THEN drift is reported deterministically
- AND stale generated config is not treated as authoritative evidence.

### Requirement: Verification safety rails

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.verification] The workspace MUST maintain focused positive and negative tests, formatting, linting, Tiger Style, generated-config drift checks, feature checks, and lifecycle validation evidence for behavior that crosses public API, adapter, policy, serialization, or host boundaries.

#### Scenario: Boundary changes include reviewable evidence

r[agent_harness_runtime.baseline.verification.evidence]
- GIVEN a boundary-affecting change is ready for review
- WHEN maintainers inspect its evidence
- THEN the evidence names the focused checks that cover the changed boundary
- AND unavailable checks are recorded with a blocker and next best validation path.

### Requirement: Roadmap taxonomy

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.taxonomy] Animus MUST classify active Cairn changes by roadmap role, including foundational lifecycle, core-runtime contract, host-adapter, optional-reference, product-surface, and evaluation-only roles.

#### Scenario: Active changes have roadmap roles

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.taxonomy.classified]
- GIVEN the Cairn tree contains active changes
- WHEN the roadmap classification is checked
- THEN each active change has exactly one primary role
- AND optional secondary relationships are represented as explicit prerequisite or related-change links.

### Requirement: Dependency order

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.dependency_order] The roadmap MUST define prerequisite tiers that land accepted baseline specs and local validation wiring before runtime behavior, reusable runtime contracts before concrete host adapters, and core safety contracts before product surfaces.

#### Scenario: Dependent change waits for prerequisite contracts

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.dependency_order.blocks_dependents]
- GIVEN a change depends on runtime loop, injected services, receipts, ledger, event, policy, or host-adapter contracts
- WHEN the prerequisite requirement IDs are not accepted, not in the same archive batch, and not explicitly waived
- THEN roadmap validation reports the dependency as blocked
- AND the dependent change is not marked archive-ready.

### Requirement: Overlap resolution

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.overlap_resolution] The roadmap MUST assign ownership for overlapping ledger, receipt, provider, hook, manifest, catalog, and tool-contract concerns so duplicate changes converge on shared requirement IDs instead of creating incompatible contracts.

#### Scenario: Overlapping changes share owners

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.overlap_resolution.shared_owner]
- GIVEN two active changes describe similar ledger, receipt, provider, hook, manifest, catalog, or tool behavior
- WHEN maintainers classify the changes
- THEN one owning concept and prerequisite path is recorded
- AND the non-owning change links to that owner or narrows itself to evaluation-only scope.

### Requirement: Roadmap validation

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.validation] Animus SHOULD provide a deterministic roadmap fixture or static check that detects unknown change IDs, unknown prerequisite requirement IDs, dependency cycles, unclassified active changes, and product-surface changes that bypass foundational safety contracts.

#### Scenario: Invalid roadmap fails closed

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.validation.negative]
- GIVEN roadmap fixtures include an unknown change ID, unknown prerequisite ID, dependency cycle, unclassified change, or unsafe product-surface shortcut
- WHEN roadmap validation runs
- THEN validation fails with deterministic issue codes
- AND the diagnostics do not depend on filesystem ordering or ambient state.

### Requirement: Roadmap closeout evidence

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.closeout] Roadmap sequencing work MUST produce reviewable evidence that lifecycle validation, roadmap validation, and Cairn gates pass before the change is archived.

#### Scenario: Sequencing evidence is reviewable

r[agent_harness_runtime.roadmap_sequence.closeout.evidence]
- GIVEN the roadmap sequencing change is ready to archive
- WHEN reviewers inspect the evidence
- THEN the evidence names successful lifecycle validation, focused roadmap checks, and Cairn proposal/design/tasks gates
- AND any unavailable check has a blocker and a next best validation path.

### Requirement: Generated policy artifact

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.generated_artifact] Animus MUST provide repo-local Cairn generated policy data at the path expected by default Cairn runtime validation, or an equivalent repo-owned wrapper that resolves the policy without hidden session-specific absolute paths.

#### Scenario: Default validation finds policy

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.generated_artifact.default_path]
- GIVEN a developer runs Cairn validation from the Animus repository root
- WHEN no explicit external policy path is supplied
- THEN validation loads the repo-owned policy artifact or wrapper-resolved policy
- AND it does not depend on a private checkout path.

### Requirement: Policy refresh documentation

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.refresh_docs] Animus MUST document the policy source, refresh command, check command, and expected default validation command for Cairn lifecycle artifacts.

#### Scenario: Maintainer refreshes policy intentionally

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.refresh_docs.reproducible]
- GIVEN the canonical Cairn policy source changes
- WHEN a maintainer refreshes Animus policy wiring
- THEN the documentation names the source identity and commands used
- AND the generated artifact can be reviewed as an intentional lifecycle dependency update.

### Requirement: Policy drift check

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.drift_check] Animus SHOULD provide a deterministic policy drift check or documented fixture that compares the checked-in generated policy to the canonical exported policy when the source is available.

#### Scenario: Stale policy is detected

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.drift_check.stale]
- GIVEN the checked-in generated policy differs from the canonical exported policy
- WHEN the drift check runs with the source available
- THEN the check fails with a deterministic diagnostic
- AND it reports the source identity without embedding secrets or local-only full paths in durable evidence.

### Requirement: Default Cairn validation

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.default_validation] Animus lifecycle validation MUST be runnable through the default Cairn validation command from the repository root without requiring a developer to remember an external policy argument.

#### Scenario: Validation is local and reproducible

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.default_validation.local]
- GIVEN the repository contains lifecycle artifacts and policy wiring
- WHEN `cairn validate --root .` or the pinned equivalent runs
- THEN validation succeeds or fails only on lifecycle/policy content
- AND missing external checkout paths are not reported as validation blockers.

### Requirement: Policy evidence

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.evidence] Cairn policy validation evidence SHOULD record policy source identity, policy hash when available, validation command, and validation result.

#### Scenario: Reviewers can audit policy used for validation

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.evidence.reviewable]
- GIVEN lifecycle validation evidence is attached to a change
- WHEN reviewers inspect it
- THEN the evidence identifies which policy artifact was used
- AND it includes enough stable identity to reproduce or challenge the validation result.

### Requirement: Policy wiring closeout

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.closeout] Policy wiring work MUST run default validation, explicit-policy validation when available, and Cairn proposal/design/tasks gates before archive.

#### Scenario: Policy wiring closeout is reviewable

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_policy.closeout.evidence]
- GIVEN the policy wiring change is ready to archive
- WHEN reviewers inspect closeout evidence
- THEN default validation, explicit-policy validation, and relevant Cairn gates are named with their status
- AND unavailable checks include a blocker and next best validation path.

### Requirement: Lifecycle layout

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.lifecycle_layout] Animus MUST treat `cairn/specs/` as the accepted requirements baseline, `cairn/changes/` as active change deltas, and `cairn/archive/` as completed lifecycle history once changes are accepted and archived.

#### Scenario: Accepted spec is source of current requirements

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.lifecycle_layout.accepted_baseline]
- GIVEN a requirement has been accepted and synced
- WHEN maintainers inspect current lifecycle requirements
- THEN the requirement appears under `cairn/specs/`
- AND the completed change package is archived rather than left as active planning state.

### Requirement: Change threshold guidance

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.change_threshold] Animus MUST document when work requires a Cairn change package, including public behavior, compatibility semantics, mutation behavior, architecture, receipt/schema contracts, release/evidence contracts, roadmap scope, and safety-boundary changes.

#### Scenario: Small safe edits can stay direct

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.change_threshold.direct_safe_edit]
- GIVEN a change is limited to typo repair, fixture hardening, or narrow documentation cleanup
- WHEN it does not affect public behavior, architecture, compatibility, mutation, schema, receipt, or roadmap scope
- THEN maintainers may apply it directly
- AND ordinary repository checks still provide evidence.

### Requirement: Gate workflow

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.gate_workflow] Animus MUST define a lifecycle workflow for proposal, design, tasks, validation, sync dry-run, archive dry-run, and executed archive closeout using Cairn commands or pinned equivalents.

#### Scenario: Change cannot archive without gates

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.gate_workflow.blocks_incomplete]
- GIVEN an active Cairn change lacks passing proposal, design, tasks, validation, or sync/archive dry-run evidence
- WHEN maintainers attempt closeout
- THEN the change is not considered archive-ready
- AND blockers or waivers are recorded explicitly.

### Requirement: Bounded evidence contract

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.evidence_contract] Cairn lifecycle evidence SHOULD record command identity, status, issue codes, requirement/change IDs, policy source identity, policy hash when available, output artifact hashes, and unavailable-check blockers while keeping evidence bounded and reviewable.

#### Scenario: Policy identity is visible in evidence

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.evidence_contract.policy]
- GIVEN Cairn validation or gates run under a policy artifact
- WHEN evidence is recorded
- THEN the evidence identifies the policy source or artifact and hash when available
- AND reviewers can tell which policy accepted the lifecycle content.

### Requirement: Safe evidence summaries

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.safe_evidence] Durable Cairn evidence summaries MUST omit raw prompts, credentials, provider payloads, full private paths, raw private file bodies, and unbounded command output by default.

#### Scenario: Evidence summary redacts private material

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.safe_evidence.redacted]
- GIVEN validation, gate, sync, archive, release-readiness, or workspace-check output includes private or unbounded material
- WHEN durable evidence is summarized
- THEN it includes bounded status, counts, issue codes, hashes, and safe relative labels
- AND raw sensitive material is omitted or replaced by approved redaction markers.

### Requirement: Cairn dogfood closeout

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.closeout] Cairn dogfood work MUST run validation, proposal/design/tasks gates, and sync/archive dry runs for the change itself before archive.

#### Scenario: Dogfood evidence is reviewable

r[agent_harness_runtime.cairn_dogfood.closeout.evidence]
- GIVEN Cairn dogfood work is ready to archive
- WHEN reviewers inspect evidence
- THEN validation, gates, sync dry-run, archive dry-run, and evidence-safety checks are named with status
- AND unavailable checks include a blocker and next best validation path.

### Requirement: Clankers product surfaces are rejected as defaults

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.docs] Animus MUST document that it adapts bounded Clankers patterns while rejecting Clankers product surfaces as default reusable Animus behavior.

#### Scenario: Rejected surfaces are explicit

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.docs.explicit]
- GIVEN maintainers review Clankers references in Animus
- WHEN they inspect the architecture note
- THEN it explicitly rejects default adoption of Clankers TUI, daemon/attach protocol, Matrix/P2P, global `.clankers` state, provider router/OAuth, plugin subprocess runtime, Wasm/Extism loading, Automerge desktop storage, self-evolution apply/rollback, live dogfood harnesses, product tools, and release tagging workflow
- AND it distinguishes those surfaces from adopted boundary patterns.

### Requirement: Reusable crates remain product-surface free

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.dependency_isolation] Reusable Animus crates and default std-shell contracts MUST NOT require Clankers product crates, daemon/TUI concepts, global state directories, Matrix/P2P, plugin runtimes, Automerge storage, OAuth/provider router, self-evolution workflows, product tools, or dogfood harnesses.

#### Scenario: Dependency isolation rail rejects product leakage

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.dependency_isolation.rail]
- GIVEN reusable Animus crate dependencies and source markers are checked
- WHEN a rejected Clankers product surface appears as a runtime dependency or assumption
- THEN the rail fails with an actionable diagnostic
- AND bounded-reference documentation mentions remain allowed only in documented reference sections.

### Requirement: Future exceptions require explicit Cairn scope

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.future_exception] Any future change that adopts a previously rejected Clankers product surface MUST create a focused Cairn change that names host ownership, injected service boundaries, safety policy, redacted receipts, non-default feature gating, and focused validation rails.

#### Scenario: Future exception is gated

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.future_exception.gated]
- GIVEN a maintainer wants to add a daemon, TUI, plugin runtime, provider router, Matrix/P2P, global state, or self-evolution surface
- WHEN the proposal is reviewed
- THEN it includes a focused Cairn change with host ownership, injected services, safety policy, redacted receipts, feature gating, and validation rails
- AND the surface remains non-default unless the change explicitly justifies default behavior.

### Requirement: Marker rail guards non-adoption

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.marker_rail] Animus MUST provide a focused marker or dependency rail that allows bounded-reference docs while rejecting product-surface dependencies or runtime assumptions in reusable crates.

#### Scenario: Product rejection closeout is evidenced

r[agent_harness_runtime.clankers_product_rejection.closeout]
- GIVEN the product-surface rejection change is ready to archive
- WHEN closeout validation runs
- THEN evidence includes docs checks, dependency/marker rail results, Cairn validation, and Cairn gates
- AND skipped checks record a blocker and next-best validation.
